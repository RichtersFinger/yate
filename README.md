# yate
"Yet Another Tabletop Experience" is a simple Node.js-based engine to play games with friends in your browser. 
This project was initiated due to restrictions regarding personal contacts in early 2020 and the consequential limited options to play games with friends.
Originally, yate was intended as an engine solely for playing Pen&Paper games.
However, yate has since grown to support many more game elements (like cards or lotteries) needed up to the point where most games can be played out-of-the-box.
Its advantage compared to other board game simulations is the compatibility since only a modern browser is required to play.
Have a look at the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_QIouG5f1K7kbNoxriW3LA) for a trailer and examples for the game management.

## Setup
## Features
## Planned Additions
Since yate is written in JavaScript you can easily implement modifications you may need for some specific kind of game.
You are free to suggest features or even the code that implements those features to be added to this repository.
Please refer to me via [mail](mailto:mail.yateofficial@gmail.com).

Next on the list of features/changes to be implemented:
* **Copy**: Include copy functionality for more game elements than only player/npc tokens.
* **Silent Lottery**: Add setting for lottery to not print results to log. 
* **Chat**: Minimal text chat window. 
* **Help**: Include in-game information regarding controls.
* **Cleanup**: Due to the grown nature of yate, it is a (for now persistent) goal to clean up the code base and unify functionalities.

## Issues
Due to the afore mentioned history regarding yate's development the code itself is rather messy.
As stated in the [Planned Additions](#planned-additions) section, the cleanup will require more time especially as it is (at the moment) low priority.
